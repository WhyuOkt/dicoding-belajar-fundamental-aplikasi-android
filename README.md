This repository is the result of my submission in [Dicoding](https://www.dicoding.com) in the class [Learning Fundamentals of Android Applications](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/14) that implements MVVM(Model View ViewModel) architecture using the components ViewModel, LiveData, Dagger2, Room, RxJava, etc.
